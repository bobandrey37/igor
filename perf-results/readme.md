# Performance tests

This directory has some initial performance tests. Collected using the `test/perf_test.py` script.

Naming convention: _igorversion-pythonversion-framework-machine.txt_.

Machines used: 

- _rpi3_ is a fairly standard Raspberry PI 3 running the latest Raspbian (Jack's _framboos_ at home).
- _i3imac_ is a mid-2010 3.2GHz i3 iMac with an SSD (Jack's _boom_ at home).
