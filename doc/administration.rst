Administration
==============

To be supplied. For now, the Igor homepage has a number of quick links
to allow you to:

- login (use *admin* to administer the service)
- change your password
- add, edit and delete users (through :doc:`std-plugins/user/readme`)
- add, edit and delete devices (through :doc:`std-plugins/device/readme`)
- add, edit and delete actions (through :doc:`std-plugins/actions/readme`)
- edit any data item (through :doc:`std-plugins/editData/readme`)
- administration of SSL certificates (through :doc:`std-plugins/ca/readme`)
- administration of capabilities
- install and delete plugins (but for device plugins use the device interface)
- view the high-level status of everything (through :doc:`std-plugins/systemHealth/readme`)
- view the service log
- view the internal REST action status
