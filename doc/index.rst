Getting started
===============

First read the :doc:`overview` to get a feeling for what Igor does, how it does it
and whether this fits your needs. Also check the :doc:`available standard plugins <std-plugins/readme>`
to check for which devices and services plugins are available, and that these
match the things you want to use Igor for.

Then read the documentation on :doc:`installing the software <install>` and install
the Igor software. Next you should check :doc:`setup` which will tell you how to initialize
your database, with the various options you want (mainly to do with security and
access control).

Then :doc:`administration` and :doc:`programs` will show you how to use Igor in
normal operation.

To interface between Igor and other applications or services you should check the
:doc:`programs` documentation for interfacing to shell scripts, :doc:`modules` for
interfacing to Python programs and :doc:`rest` for interfacing to REST services.
